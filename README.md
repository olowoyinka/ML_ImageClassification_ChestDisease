# ML_ImageClassification_ChestDisease


## DESCRIPTION

It is so obvious that an average **PULMONOLOGIST** spent several hour to diagnosis a sample image of X-Ray chest. Most especially, the diagnosis involve classifying the kind of chest disease from the image. 

Our project provides a Web based solution for **PULMONOLOGIST**.

This solution helps to visually inspect a sample of X-Ray chest images in order to classify or predict the image according to the categories of Chest Disease.

Various categories of Chest Disease that could been classified in this solution are **Atelectasis**, **Infiltration**, **Effusion**, **Cardiomegaly** and **Fibrosis**.

We leverage on Deep Learning Image Classification Model with ML.NET and Tensorflow to train the model used for the prediction or classifying the sample images

The Dataset for the training the model was found in **Kaggle** https://www.kaggle.com/yashprakash13/chest-xrays-dataset
