This is a Web based solution for **PULMONOLOGIST**.

This solution helps to visually inspect a sample of X-Ray chest images inorder to classify or predict the image according to the categories of Chest Disease.

Various categories of Chest Disease that could been classified in this solution are **Atelectasis**, **Infiltration**, **Effusion**, **Cardiomegaly** and **Fibrosis**.

We make use of a Deep Learning Image Classification Model with ML.NET and Tensorflow.

The Dataset for the training the model was found in **Kaggle** https://www.kaggle.com/yashprakash13/chest-xrays-dataset
